37. **ArithmeticException:**
    Show the use of `ArithmeticException`.
38. **Multiple Catch Blocks:**
    Demonstrate the use of multiple catch blocks.
39. **Nested Try Statement:**
    Show the use of nested try statements.
40. **Throw Throwable Object:**
    Throw a `Throwable` object from try and catch blocks.
41. **Throws Keyword:**
    Demonstrate the use of the `throws` keyword.

### Multithreading:
42. **Addition by Two Threads:**
    Add numbers from 1 to 1000 using two threads.
43. **Thread Priority:**
    Show that higher-priority threads get more CPU time.
